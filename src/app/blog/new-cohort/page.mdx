# From Ideas to Impact: kicking off our new cohort + an open call to future founders

**Come build with us.**

At PL Venture Studio (PLVS), we believe the next wave of transformative companies will be built on breakthrough infrastructure - scalable, decentralized, and future-proof. Today, we're excited to announce the launch of our latest cohort: a curated group of early-stage teams and technical founders working at the frontier of data, compute, and coordination.

And we're just getting started.

## Why We Exist

Startups are hard. Starting without a co-builder is even harder.

At PLVS, we work shoulder-to-shoulder with ambitious founders from day one: shaping ideas, validating market pull, and building with the Protocol Labs ecosystem.

We're not just investors, we're co-builders.

Through our venture studio model, we provide hands-on support, product co-design, early access to funding, and connections to the Protocol Labs network.

## Inside This Cohort

Our latest cohort kicks off with two boundary-pushing teams:

### ðŸ’² Allo Protocol

Allo is reimagining capital allocation for the internet age. Built by the Gitcoin team, Allo is an open protocol for transparent, programmable, and community-driven capital deployment. It enables new funding mechanisms like Quadratic Funding, empowering communities to decide what gets built.

We're excited to support Allo's journey as they expand their protocol tooling and work to onboard the next generation of builders and funders into web3-native coordination models.

### ðŸ¤– FrodoBots

FrodoBots is building smart agents that connect users with onchain actions - think of it as a personal assistant for the decentralized world. Their AI-powered agents interpret natural language, automate wallet tasks, and navigate protocols on your behalf. It's the interface crypto has been waiting for.

Over the next few months, these teams will go from exploration to execution - building prototypes, testing with users, and preparing to launch!

## Who We're Looking For

We're looking for the relentless. The ones who can't sit still because they see cracks in the current system - and want to build something better.

Whether you're obsessed with decentralized systems, robots, or protocol-native economies, we want to work with you. Maybe you've already started tinkering. Maybe the idea is still forming. What matters is that you're here to build something ambitious.

You might be:
- A technical founder with a side project that won't leave your mind.
- An operator who sees the gap no one else does.
- A product builder waiting for the right idea and the right crew.
- A generalist hungry to dive deep and commit to a problem that actually matters.

You don't need a deck. You don't need a startup.

You need obsession. Curiosity. Founder energy.

We'll bring the rest.

## Join Us

We believe great founders come from unexpected places - and that entrepreneurship isn't a job title, it's a mindset. If you've ever felt the pull to build, now's the time.

Apply here.

Let's build something enduring.
