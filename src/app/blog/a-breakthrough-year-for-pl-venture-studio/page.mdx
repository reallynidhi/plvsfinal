# 2024: A Breakthrough Year for PL Venture Studio

As 2024 comes to a close, we at Protocol Labs Venture Studio (PLVS) are excited to reflect on a year filled with innovation, growth, and groundbreaking contributions to the decentralized internet ecosystem. This year, we have championed founders building transformative technologies within the Protocol Labs network and beyond.

Our journey has been driven by exceptional founders, bold ideas, and an unwavering commitment to advancing open-source projects that shape the future of Web3, cloud infrastructure, and decentralized technology. Here's a wrap-up of our accomplishments and the incredible portfolio companies driving change:

## Highlights from 2024

Our key achievements include graduating 12 exceptional teams working on transformative solutions, introducing new initiatives and support programs for early-stage founders, hosting impactful founder events across global locations, and welcoming a diverse portfolio of innovative startups.

Throughout the year, we hosted workshops, gatherings, and dinners from Buenos Aires in August to Singapore in September and Bangkok in November, which have deepened our faith in this initiative and catalyzed new partnerships.

We welcomed a diverse cohort of startups this year, ranging from energy solutions to cutting-edge AI and data infrastructures. Each company represents a unique perspective on solving some of the most complex challenges in technology today.

## Our Portfolio in 2024

This year, PLVS successfully graduated 12 amazing teams working on transformative solutions. Among them, three teams stood out for achieving exceptional growth and valuations: Akave, Storacha, and Randamu.

### Akave

Akave is redefining privacy and security with next-generation zero-knowledge proof systems. Their work enables scalable, privacy-preserving solutions for decentralized networks. Their innovative approach to cryptographic computation has positioned them as a leader in the privacy technology sector, driving adoption across Web3 applications.
